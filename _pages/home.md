    excerpt: '**Guoxiao Guo, Director of System Design at Western Digital Corp and coauthor of "Hard disk drive: mechatronics and control"**: "Introduction to Modern Controls with Illustrations in MATLAB and Python" is a well-rounded textbook that expertly combines theoretical depth with practical application. Its clear explanations, extensive examples, and practical exercises make it an invaluable resource for mastering modern control systems. The practical methodologies and tools provided have equipped many engineers with the skills necessary to innovate and excel in this field. The practical relevance of the book is further enhanced by its use of real-world examples. For instance, the inclusion of applications such as atomic force microscopy and hard disk drive (HDD) information storage systems not only illustrates the principles discussed but also highlights their practical significance. The authorsâ€™ experience in academia and industry is evident, particularly in how the book addresses the needs of both students and practicing engineers. The impact of the training offered by this framework is evident in the remarkable contributions of its (and its previous versions) readers to industries such as HDD manufacturing. I highly recommend this book for its educational value and practical utility.<br> @pauloaraujo: I was looking for a course like this for so long! Thanks for sharing it, Professor! <br> @KeHan918: Thanks for your video, Really appreciate it. Clear explanation and still useful in 2024. <br> @chang-hongchen6804: Thank you professor, the lecture is so far the best control course I took. It is very intuitive and uses lots of hands-on examples. Different point of views are given in certain control concepts making me understanding the big picture of modern control theory. <br> @el_witcher: Thanks for making these lectures available for free, Prof. Greetings from Germany! <br> @alkis0560: I almost can not believe I actually understood that. Though I would never notice the trick about using the fact that we know we are using a ZOH, so u(tau) is a constant. Also, now I appreciate how it simplifies the integral. <br> @weiguozhang17: intuitive and clear, thx!'
